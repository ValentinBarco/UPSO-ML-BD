# Mystery at the Wildlife Preserve: Vehicle Patterns of Life

## Background
Mistford is a mid-size city is located to the southwest of a large nature preserve. The city has a small industrial area with four light-manufacturing endeavors.  Mitch Vogel is a post-doc student studying ornithology at Mistford College and has been discovering signs that the number of nesting pairs of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit, a popular local bird due to its attractive plumage and pleasant songs, is decreasing! The decrease is sufficiently significant that the Pangera Ornithology Conservation Society is sponsoring Mitch to undertake additional studies to identify the possible reasons. Mitch is gaining access to several datasets that may help him in his work, and he has asked you (and your colleagues) as experts in visual analytics to help him analyze these datasets.

As part of his investigation, ornithology student Mitch Vogel needs to examine the movement of traffic through the Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve. His first working hypothesis is that there is some link between the traffic going through the preserve and the decline in the nesting Rose-crested Blue Pipit—maybe the traffic noises are drowning out mating calls! Or perhaps he can discover some odd goings on in the traffic patterns—perhaps campers are invading the bird’s habitat areas?

There are park rangers working as caretakers of the nature preserve, and they have been collecting traffic data for their annual reporting to the local government. They have provided Mitch with some data, explanations about the data, and a map. Mitch feels unprepared to analyze this information alone and is asking you to help with your data analytics prowess. Use data analytics to explore the available data and develop responses to the questions below. 

### Data - *[Download](https://github.com/emmanueliarussi/DataScienceCapstone/tree/master/7_FinalProjects/MysteryWildlifePreserveIVehiclePatternsLife/data/task1.zip)*

You are provided with a description of how traffic through the Preserve occurs and how traffic was measured through
the sensors. You are also given some background information about the Preserve and bitmapped files describing the gridded map against which the data is provided. The data contains a timestamp of when the vehicle passed a sensor location, a car-id, a car type (as described in the background information), and a sensor identification.

### Goals

1. “Patterns of Life” analyses depend on recognizing repeating patterns of activities by individuals or groups. Describe up to six daily patterns of life by vehicles traveling through and within the park. Characterize the patterns by describing the kinds of vehicles participating, their spatial activities (where do they go?), their temporal activities (when does the pattern happen?), and provide a hypothesis of what the pattern represents (for example, if I drove to a coffee house every morning, but did not stay for long, you might hypothesize I’m getting coffee “to-go”).
2. Patterns of Life analyses may also depend on understanding what patterns appear over longer periods of time (in this case, over multiple days). Describe up to six patterns of life that occur over multiple days (including across the entire data set) by vehicles traveling through and within the park. Characterize the patterns by describing the kinds of vehicles participating, their spatial activities (where do they go?), their temporal activities (when does the pattern happen?), and provide a hypothesis of what the pattern represents (for example, many vehicles showing up at the same location each Saturday at the same time may suggest some activity occurring there each Saturday).
3. Unusual patterns may be patterns of activity that changes from an established pattern, or are just difficult to explain from what you know of a situation. Describe up to six unusual patterns (either single day or multiple days) and highlight why you find them unusual.
4. What are the top 3 patterns you discovered that you suspect could be most impactful to bird life in the nature preserve? 

## Deliverables

Please prepare __a single python notebook__ with the answers. However, feel free to use more than a single python file to solve tasks. If necessary, some results may be pre-computed and stored in separate files. Notebooks must clearly explain the answers to each question, supported by evidence derived from the data and visualized using the tools seen in the course. Describe the characteristics of the data you were given as well as your reasoning process leading to each answer. Use the following structure template for the answers notebook:

- project title, task name
    - description and data characterization 
    - answer question 1
    - answer question 2
    - ...
